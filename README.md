# Python-Sales-Analysis-using-Pandas
Tasks during this section include:
*Drop NaN values from DataFrame*
*Removing rows based on a condition
*Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)
*Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. 

Problem Statements with 5 high level business questions related to our data:
1.What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2.What city sold the most product?
3.What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
4.What products are most often sold together?
5.What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

Methods and ways used to solve:
*Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
*Adding columns
*Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
*Using the .apply() method
*Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
*Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
*Labeling our graphs
